== Requirements

* https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust]
* https://cmake.org/[CMake]
* https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home[Vulkan SDK]

=== macOS

Install `rustup-init` via Homebrew: `brew install rustup-init`, then run `rustup-init` and follow the instructions.

Install CMake via Homebrew: `brew install cmake`.

Unpack the Vulkan SDK to a directory, for example `~/.vulkansdk`.
Then export the following environment variables, assuming `VULKAN_SDK` is set to the directory where the SDK was unpacked to:

* `VK_LAYER_PATH="$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/explicit_layer.d"`
* `VK_ICD_FILENAMES="$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json"`
* `VK_LOADER_DEBUG="warn"`

For example, add the following to your `~/.profile` file:

[bash]
----
export VULKAN_SDK="$HOME/.vulkansdk/macOS"
export VK_LAYER_PATH="$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/explicit_layer.d"
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES="$VULKAN_SDK/etc/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json"
export VK_LOADER_DEBUG="warn"
----

== Compiling/Running

Compile and run with `cargo run --package client`.

=== macOS

Set the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to `$VULKAN_SDK/macOS/lib` when running. For example:

[bash]
----
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$VULKAN_SDK/macOS/lib" cargo run --package client
----
